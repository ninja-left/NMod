# NMod
## What?
Mod that adds stuff from RekMOD and maybe some other Mods I like.

## Why?
I don't want to change base rulset; which is required for NekMOD. The reason is I like the espionage mechanism.

## Stuff that are in this Mod

- Policies:
  - Order
  - Freedom
  - Autocracy

- Nations (Includes their units & buildings too):
  - America*
  - Canada
  - Israel
  - Gaul
  - Goths
  - Italy
  - Mexico

* The added America changes city names, adds nation-specific units instead of existing ones.

- Units Types
  - Spies (units are named as "Agent"), semi-invisible ranged units
